## Title: Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do

## Defining Data Science

### What is Data Science?

* Data science is the field of exploring, manipulating, and analyzing data, and using data to answer questions or make recommendations
	* Although the different data scientists seemed to have different point of view, but they all agreed that data science involved using data to answer questions or make recommendations

### Fundamentals of Data Science

* **Data Science** - Most people agree that it has a significant data analysis component
* Sources of data available
	* from log files
	* email
	* social media
	* sales data
	* patient information files
	* sports performance data
	* sensor data
	* security cameras, etc...
* At the same time that there is more data available than ever, we have the computing power needed to make a useful analysis and reveal new knowledge
* Data science can help organizations 
	1. understand their environments
	1. analyze existing issues
	1. reveal previously hidden opportunities
* Data scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by 
	1. investigating data
	1. exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business
* Data scientists are curious people who ask questions to clarify the business need
	1. what data do we need to solve the problem
	1. where will that data come from?
* Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers; sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach
* When the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller, communicating the results to the project stakeholders
* Data scientists can use powerful data visualization tools to help stakeholders understand the nature of the results, and the recommended action to take

### The Many Paths to Data Science

* As data science is not a discipline traditionally taught at universities, contemporary data scientists come from diverse backgrounds such as engineering, statistics, and physics.
* Contemporary data scientists come from different backgrounds such as engineering, mathematics, and even psychology. The secret skill is passion for continuous learning of new tools and patience to clean and analyze data

### Advice for New Data Scientists

* Advice to an aspiring data scientist is to be curious, extremely argumentative and judgmental
	* Curiosity is absolute must. If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data
	* Judgmental because if you do not have preconceived notions about things you wouldn't know where to begin with
	* Argumentative because if you can argument and if you can plead a case, at least you can start somewhere and then you learn from data and then you modify your assumptions and hypotheses and your data would help you learn
* Secondary, thing that the data scientist would need is some comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms
* The last thing that a data scientist need, and that is the ability to tell a story
	* Once you have your analytics, once you have your tabulations, now you should be able to tell a great story from it.
		* Because if you don't tell a great story from it, your findings will remain hidden, remain buried, nobody would know
* Your **competitive advantage** is your understanding of some aspect of life where you exceed beyond others in understanding that
	1. Maybe it's film
	1. Maybe it's retail
	1. Maybe it's health
	1. Maybe it's computers

#### Lesson Summary

* In this lesson, you have learned
	1. Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.
	1. There are  many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involve a little math, a little science, and a lot of curiosity about data.
	1. New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.
	1. Why data science is considered the sexiest job in the 20th century, paying high salaries for skilled workers.


## What Do Data Scientists Do?

### A day in the Life of a Data Scientist

* Nothing worth writing down

### Old problems, new problems, Data Science solutions

* All organizations ultimately use data science for the same reason—to discover optimum solutions to existing problems
* three examples of data science providing innovative solutions for old problems
	1. In transport, Uber collects real-time user data to discover how many drivers are available, if more are needed, and if they should allow a surge charge to attract more drivers
		* Uber uses data to put the right number of drivers in the right place, at the right time, for a cost the rider is willing to pay
	1. In a different transport related data science effort, the Toronto Transportation Commission has made great strides in solving an old problem with traffic flows, restructuring those flows in and around the city
		* Using data science tools and analysis, they have: Gathered data to better understand streetcar operations, and identify areas for interventions
		* Analyzed customer complaints data Used probe data to better understand traffic performance on main routes Created a team to better capitalize on big data for both planning, operations and evaluation
		* By focusing on peak hour clearances and identifying the most congested routes, monthly hours lost for commuters due to traffic congestion dropped from 4.75 hrs. in 2010 to 3 hrs. in mid-2014
	1. facing issues in our environment, data science can also play a proactive role
		* Freshwater lakes supply a variety of human and ecological needs, such as providing drinking water and producing food
		* But lakes across the world are threatened by increasing incidences of harmful cyanobacterial blooms
		* In the US, a team of scientists from research centers stretching from Maine to South Carolina is developing and deploying high-tech tools to explore cyanobacteria in lakes across the east coast
			* The team is using robotic boats, buoys, and camera-equipped drones to measure physical, chemical, and biological data in lakes where cyanobacteria are detected, collecting large volumes of data related to the lakes and the development of the harmful blooms
			* The information collected will lead to better predictions of when and where cyanobacterial blooms take place, enabling proactive approaches to protect public health in recreational lakes and in those that supply drinking water
* It takes gathering a lot of data, cleaning and preparing it, and then analyzing it to gain the insight needed to develop better solutions for today's enterprises
* How do you get a better solution that is efficient?
	* You must: 
		1. Identify the problem and establish a clear understanding of it
		1. Gather the data for analysis
		1. Identify the right tools to use. Develop a data strategy
		1. Case studies are also helpful in customizing a potential solution
	* Once these conditions exist and available data is extracted, you can develop a machine learning model

### Data Science Topics and Algorithms

> Using complicated machine learning algorithms does not always guarantee achieving a better performance. Occasionally, a simple algorithm such as k-nearest neighbor can yield a satisfactory performance comparable to the one achieved using a complicated algorithm. It all depends on the data
#
> In any field, and data science is no different, a simple solution is always preferred over a complicated one, especially if the performance is comparable.

1. Regression
1. Data Visualization
	* it's a key element for people to get across their message to people that don't understand that well what data science is
1. Artificial neural networks
	* we have a lot to learn with nature so when we are trying to mimic our, our brain I think that we can do some applications with this behavior with this biological behavior in algorithms
1. Data visualization with R
1. K-Nearest neighbor
	* It's the simplest but it just gets the best results so many more times than some overblown, overworked algorithm that's just as likely to overfit as it is to make a good fit
* Types of data
	* structured data is more like tabular data things that you’re familiar with in Microsoft Excel format. You've got rows and columns and that's called structured data.
	* Unstructured data is basically data that is coming from mostly from web where it's not tabular. It is not, it's not in rows and columns. It's text. It's sometimes it's video and audio, so you would have to deploy more sophisticated algorithms to extract data
* **Regression** in the simplest possible terms
	* if you have ever taken a cab ride, a taxi ride, you understand regression
		* The moment you sit in a cab ride, in a cab, you see that there's a fixed amount there. It says $2.50
			* You, rather the cab, moves or you get off. This is what you owe to the driver the moment you step into a cab
				* That's a constant, You have to pay that amount if you have stepped into a cab
			* Then as it starts moving for every meter or hundred meters the fare increases by certain amount
			* there's a fraction, there's a relationship between distance and the amount you would pay above and beyond that constant
			* if you're not moving and you're stuck in traffic, then every additional minute you have to pay more
			* So as the minutes increase, your fare increases
			* As the distance increases, your fare increases
			* while all this is happening you've already paid a base fare which is the constant
			* This is what regression is
		* **Regression** tells you what the base fare is and what is the relationship between time and the fare you have paid, and the distance you have traveled and the fare you've paid

### Cloud for Data Science

* Cloud is a godsend for data scientists primarily because you take your data, take your information, and put it in the Cloud, put it in the central storage system
* It allows you to bypass the physical limitations of the computers and the systems you're using, and it allows you to deploy the analytics and storage capacities of advanced machines that do not necessarily have to be your machine or your company's machine
* Cloud allows you not just to store large amounts of data 
* It also allows you to deploy very advanced computing algorithms and the ability to do high performance computing using machines that are not yours
* It allows multiple entities to work with same data at the same time

#### Lesson Summary

* In this lesson, you have learned:
	1. The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.
	1. Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. 
	1. Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the Cloud enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.
