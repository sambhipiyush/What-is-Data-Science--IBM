### How Data Science is saving lives

* Using Data Science techniques to understand and analyze the large data sets available today has a huge impact on human lives
	* It can provide targeted information to 
		* help healthcare professionals give the best treatment to patients
		* help predict natural disasters so that people can prepare early
* In healthcare, data scientists use predictive analytics developed from data mining, data modeling, statistics, and machine learning to find the best options for patients
	* This type of predictive analytics examines all known factors for a disease, including gene markers, associated conditions, and environmental factors
	* It then recommends appropriate tests, suitable trials, and any suggested treatments
* Every individual physician has their own store of knowledge gained from their studies, interests, and experiences
* Data science systems that use predictive analytics ensure that all physicians can also access the latest information about the disease, tests, and treatment plans, tailored to their specific patient
* With this type of system, every physician has access to the same knowledge, and the best options can be consistently offered, improving patient outcomes
* For example, a study by the Boston Consulting Group and AdvaMedDx, an industry association of medical diagnostics companies, examined the barriers to the adoption of potentially lifesaving diagnostic tests for patients with a specific cancer and a particular gene marker
	* The study discovered that the biggest factor in the patient being offered a specific test was the patientâ€™s oncologist, who may or may not have known about the test and its relationship to the gene marker
	* By providing extra information through data science tools, physicians can be made aware of the most helpful tests and treatments for a specific patient
* There are many opportunities to explore other ways to mine data, such as from electronic medical records for different types of medical research
* Schools such as the NorthShore University HealthSystem in suburban Chicago, a leader in the implementation of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems, now offer guidance on data mining
	* It is the first healthcare provider in America to be awarded the highest level of EMR deployment for both inpatient and outpatient care
	* This remarkable effort has generated much-anonymized data available for innovative analytics research
* Developing more sophisticated big data analytics capabilities helps healthcare organizations move from basic descriptive analytics towards predictive insights, thanks to data science
*  In the field of Disaster Preparedness, the ability to save lives using Data Science tools has been under development for many years
* The use of predictive analytics tools is improving and providing new data analysis in a multitude of ways, alerting populations to danger faster than ever before
* Large, high-quality data sets can be used to predict the occurrence of numerous types of natural disasters, which can be the difference between life and death for thousands of people
	* Earthquakes, hurricanes & tornados, floods, and volcanic eruptions can be predicted with the help of data science
* Data science tools enable organizations to analyse vast quantities of data from widely different sources, and present that information in a way that allows data scientists to gain new knowledge

### How Should Companies Get Started in Data Science?

* Nothing to write

### Applications of Data Science

* Nothing to write

#### Lesson Summary

* In this lesson, you have learned
	1. Data Science helps physicians provide the best treatment for their patients, and helps meteorologists predict the extent of local weather events, and can even help predict natural disasters like earthquakes and tornadoes.
	1. That companies can start on their data science journey by capturing data. Once they have data, they can begin analysing it.
	1. Some ways that data is generated by consumers. 
	1. How businesses like Netflix, Amazon, UPs, Google, and Apple use the data generated by their consumers and employees.
	1. The purpose of the final deliverable of a Data Science project is to communicate new information and insights from the data analysis to key decision-makers.


## Careers and Recruiting in Data Science

### How Can Someone Become a Data Scientist?

* A real data scientist, the high-end data scientists, are mostly PhDs
* They often come out of physics, out of statistics, they have to have a computer science background, they have to have a math background, they have to know about databases and statistics and probability and all that stuff
* If you're coming into a data science team, I think the first skills you need is you need to know how to program, at least have some computational thinking, so having taken a programing course, you need to know some algebra, at least up to analytics, geometry, and hopefully some calculus, some basic probability, some basic statistics, I mean really have to understand the difference and different statistical distributions, and database
* one of the easiest places to start is relational databases, which stores lots and lots of our data so people can first walk before they can run by at least understanding about computers and databases and how we store things and if you understand relational databases nowadays you can still, just with that understanding, use big data clusters as if they were just a big relational database

### Recruiting for Data Science

* When the companies are hiring people for a data science team, maybe a data scientist or an analyst, or a chief data scientist
	* the tendency would be to find the person who has all the skills, that 
		* they know the domain-specific knowledge
		* They're excellent in analyzing structured and unstructured data
		* they're great at presenting
		* they've got great storytelling skills.
* Curiosity is one of the most important skills that a data scientist should have in addition to sense of humor and story telling
* A brilliant data scientist who is passionate about the field of IT won't necessary excel in the field of healthcare if they are passionate about it.

### High School Studens and Data Science Career

* Nothing to write here

#### Lesson Summary

* In this lesson, you have learned
	1. Data Scientists need programming, mathematics, and database skills, many of which can be gained through self-learning.
	1. Companies recruiting for a Data Science team need to understand the variety of different roles Data Scientists can play, and look for soft skills like storytelling and relationship building as well as technical skills.
	1. High school students considering a career in Data Science should learn programming, math, databases, and, most importantly practice their skills.


## The Report Structure

#### Lesson Summary

* In this lesson, you have learned
	1. The length and content of the final report will vary depending on the needs of the project.
	1. The structure of the final report for a Data Science project should include a cover page, table of contents, executive summary, detailed contents, acknowledgements, references and appendices.
	1. The report should present a thorough analysis of the data and communicate the project findings.
